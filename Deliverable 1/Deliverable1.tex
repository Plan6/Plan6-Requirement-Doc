\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This section outlines the purpose and scope of the Erudite project; along with
definitions, acronyms and abbreviations used within this document; and finally
an overview of the contents and organization of this software requirements
document.


\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
This document's purpose is to outline the engineering and business decisions
made in the design portion of the Erudite project. This document will be
used to maintain a record of project's scope, constraints, assumptions,
dependencies, functional requirements, non-functional requirements and any
other design decision made over the life of this project.

The target audience for this document are the stakeholders (Dr. Ridha Khedri,
Andrew Le Clair and Michael Liut), and any current or future architects,
designers and developers of this project.


\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
This project will produce the following software products:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \underline{Android} client application
  \item Back-end web server
  \item Back-end database server
\end{itemize}

\noindent The aforementioned products preform the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide users with a graphical client-side application for creating,
    modifying and viewing server hosted content.
  \item Provide a means of retrieving and sending data between the front-end
    client and back-end web server.
  \item Provide a means of persistent storage and retrieval of content.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The aforementioned products do not preform the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Generate content.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These software products will combine to provide a content management
system for teachers and students in an educational environment. Benefits include
quick
access to educational content, efficient management of content, portability,
ease of access to content, and ease of assessing student-submitted material
(i.e. quizzes, assignments, etc). The goals of this project include providing
students and teachers with a familiar
interface to access and add content, all the while reducing any additional
overhead of maintaining a system, and providing easy accessibility to all
users.

% End Section


\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

This section of the document describes the general factors that affect the
product and its requirements, providing context for the requirements in the
following sections.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
Erudite is a distributed learning management system designed to facilitate
teachers and students with everyday \underline{classroom operations}. Erudite is
a distributed, self-contained system with several components running on
different end-user devices. Erudite is akin to other learning management
systems, such as McMaster's Avenue2Learn; however, Erudite will focus on
providing a Learning Management System for early learners and educators with
low levels of technical expertise.

Figure 1 shows an overview of the major system components of the system as well
as their external interfaces.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Major components of the system and their external interfaces.}
\end{figure}


% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
Erudite is designed to facilitate students, teachers, and administration
with common classroom operations.

As a \underline{LMS}, Erudite will allow teachers to upload a variety of
documents for
the purpose of education. Teachers are then able to set the duration that the
documents are available, as well as the \underline{access rights} users
have over the document.

Moreover, Erudite will allow teachers to create virtual mechanisms of
assessment including but not limited to quizzes and electronic assignment
submission boxes. With virtual quizzes, teachers will be able to create their
own questions and solutions.

Teachers will also be able to configure settings related to these mechanisms of
assessment including but not limited to the availability of the mechanism,
functionalities available while users are participating in the mechanism of
assessment, and the assessment scheme associated with the mechanism.

The LMS will also allow teachers to enter success metrics for each student. If
instructed to do so, the LMS will also be able to automatically assess students
based on primitive assessment schemes provided by the teacher.

Erudite will allow teachers to view statistics associated with each
\underline{mechanism of assessment}. It will create visualizations of data
generated from the results of the assessment scheme and display them to the
teacher. Statistics to be displayed to the teacher include but is not limited
to the statistical mean, the statistical mode, the variance, the standard
deviation, the point biserial, and the discrimination index. \emph{\textbf{ An
innovative feature of Erudite is that it will also keep track of the number of
students who have yet to submit relevant work to each mechanism of assessment
so that teachers may be able to contact the class to remind them of the due
date, or extend the due date.}}

On the other hand, Erudite will allow students to view documents uploaded by
the teacher. The students will be able to save a copy of the document if it is
allowed by the teacher.

Moreover, Erudite will allow students to complete virtual mechanisms of
assessments created by their teacher. The LMS will allow students to submit the
appropriate information in order to successfully complete the mechanism of
assessment. The LMS will show the student a \underline{metric of success} when
authorized by the teacher.

\emph{ \textbf{
  Erudite will allow students and teachers to customize their own user
  interface such that information each user considers relevant will be
  displayed in a convenient location. Users will also have the option of adding
  other data including but not limited to weather information, traffic
  information, and the current time.
} }

Finally, Erudite will allow administration to add or remove students from
certain domains. The LMS will allow administration to modify the
\underline{user roles} and to control what \underline{permissions} each role
has over the system.
% End SubSection

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
% Begin SubSection
Erudite is intended for 3 primary groups of users: teachers, students, and
administration.

Teachers are assumed to be adult users with the functional capacity of an
average person who is between the ages of 16 and 80. Teachers are assumed to be
fluent in written English, and have at least a basic understanding of
mathematics and statistics if they would be interested using the various
mathematical/statical data visualization features provided by the system.
Moreover, teachers are assumed to have a strong understanding of
\underline{teaching methods}; however, teachers are not assumed to be
well-versed in technology. Teachers should know how to use an Android platform
- including typing and selecting elements on the screen - however, they are not
expected to know how to know advanced features of the Android platform.

Students are assumed to be child users of ages 6 to 13, who are enrolled in a
Canadian, American, or culturally equivalent elementary school. Students are
assumed to understand basic written English at the Ontario Senior
Kindergarten/Grade 1 level. Students are expected to have vision and are able
to use the basic functions of the Android platform, albeit at a lower level
than teachers and administrations. At a minimum, students are assumed to know
how to select elements on the screen. No other prior knowledge is assumed of
the student.

The administration is assumed to be adult users with the functional capacity of
an average person who is between the ages of 16 to 80. The administration is
assumed to be fluent in written English, and have a good understanding of
mathematics and statistics. The administration is also assumed to have basic
computer knowledge, including basic troubleshooting, IT, and data entry skills.
The administration is assumed to have an intermediate understanding of common
Android platform usage, and are able to preform more advanced tasks such as
set-up, installation, and troubleshooting on such platforms.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
The application must run on the native Android platform, as per the project
specifications provided.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
It is assumed that the school using the system will have the necessary
infrastructure to support the system. The school will provide the required
hardware in order to reasonably ensure the security of the data, and to handle
the data capacity requirement.

Moreover, it is assumed that each user will have access to an Android platform
that is internet enabled.
